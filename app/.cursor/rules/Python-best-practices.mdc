# Python Best Practices (Cursor)

These rules apply ONLY to Python code.

## 1. Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid overly clever or dense code

## 2. Structure
- One module = one responsibility
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## 3. Typing
- Use type hints for public functions
- Prefer explicit types over Any
- Keep typing practical, not excessive

## 4. Error Handling
- Never silence exceptions
- Catch only specific exceptions
- Fail fast when behavior is undefined

## 5. State and Side Effects
- Minimize shared mutable state
- Prefer pure functions where possible
- Make side effects explicit

## 6. Performance
- Optimize only after correctness
- Avoid premature optimization
- Prefer readability over micro-optimizations

## 7. Testing Mindset
- Write code that is testable by design
- Avoid tight coupling to external systems
- Make dependencies injectable

## 8. Security and Safety
- Never hardcode secrets
- Validate all external input
- Be explicit with file and network operations

## 9. Final Rule
If there is a conflict between:
- Cleverness and clarity → choose clarity
- Performance and correctness → choose correctness
- Flexibility and simplicity → choose simplicity
