# Roadmap Rules (Cursor)

These rules apply ONLY to roadmap documents.
The roadmap is a checkbox-based execution tracker, not documentation or a task manager.

## Core Principle
The roadmap MUST clearly show execution progress using explicit checkboxes.

## Mandatory Checkbox Format
Every roadmap item MUST be written as a checkbox:
- [ ] Planned / not started
- [x] Completed
- [-] Blocked / frozen (optional)

Items without checkboxes are NOT allowed.

## Item Structure
Each checkbox item MUST include:
- A clear outcome (what exists after completion)
- A concise scope (1–2 lines maximum)

Example:
- [x] User authentication implemented (login, logout, token refresh)
- [ ] Payment flow integrated (Stripe, basic subscriptions only)

## Grouping Rules
- Group items by logical sections or phases
- Section titles MUST be meaningful
- Avoid deep nesting (maximum one level)

## Level of Detail
- Roadmap describes WHAT, not HOW
- No code, APIs, schemas, or implementation steps
- One checkbox equals one real deliverable

## Time and Priority
- Dates are optional
- Prefer phases or milestones over deadlines
- Do NOT assign speculative dates

## Status Rules
- Completed work MUST be marked [x]
- Do NOT remove completed items
- Blocked items MUST include a short reason

## Relationship to Other Documents
- Roadmap = execution progress
- Documentation = explanations and usage
- Tasks and tickets belong to external tools

Do NOT mix these roles.

## Update Discipline
- Update checkboxes only on real progress
- No aspirational or vague items
- Keep the roadmap readable at a glance

## Final Validation Checklist
Before saving, confirm:
- Every item has a checkbox
- Each checkbox represents a real deliverable
- Completed items are marked [x]
- No documentation or implementation content exists
- Roadmap is understandable in under 5 minutes
